# Project_1 : Data Professional Survey Breakdown 
This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard built using survey data from 630 global data professionals. The goal was to explore key trends in job roles, tools, salaries, and work preferences across different regions and experience levels. Using Power Query, the raw data was cleaned and transformed. DAX measures were used to calculate averages, counts, and create custom visuals for deeper insights

Insights: 630 respondents participated in the survey, with an average age of 29.87 years.
          Data Scientists reported the highest average salaries among all roles.
          Python was the most preferred language with 420 users, followed by R (101) and SQL-based tools.
          43% of participants found it difficult to break into data roles; only 6.9% found it very easy.
          Average happiness rating with salary was 4.27 / 10, while work-life balance scored 5.74 / 10.
